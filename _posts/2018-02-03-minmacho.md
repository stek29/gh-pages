title: Smallest runnable Mach-O
---
_Saved from [my answer on CodeGolf StackExchange](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/154685/77967)_

Smallest runnable Mach-O has to be at least `0x1000` bytes. Because of XNU limitation, file has to be at least of `PAGE_SIZE`.
See `xnu-4570.1.46/bsd/kern/mach_loader.c`, around line 1600.

However, if we don't count that padding, and only count meaningful payload, then minimal file size runnable on macOS is `0xA4` bytes.

It has to start with mach_header (or `fat_header` / `mach_header_64`, but those are bigger).

	struct mach_header {
		uint32_t	magic;		/* mach magic number identifier */
		cpu_type_t	cputype;	/* cpu specifier */
		cpu_subtype_t	cpusubtype;	/* machine specifier */
		uint32_t	filetype;	/* type of file */
		uint32_t	ncmds;		/* number of load commands */
		uint32_t	sizeofcmds;	/* the size of all the load commands */
		uint32_t	flags;		/* flags */
	};

It's size is `0x1C` bytes.  
`magic` has to be `MH_MAGIC`.  
I'll be using `CPU_TYPE_X86` since it's an `x86_32` executable.  
`filtetype` has to be `MH_EXECUTE` for executable, `ncmds` and `sizeofcmds` depend on commands, and have to be valid.  
`flags` aren't that important and are too small to provide any other value.

Next are load commands.
Header has to be exactly in one mapping, with R-X rights -- again, XNU limitations.  
We'd also need to place our code in some R-X mapping, so this is fine.  
For that we need a `segment_command`.

Let's look at definition.

	struct segment_command { /* for 32-bit architectures */
		uint32_t	cmd;		/* LC_SEGMENT */
		uint32_t	cmdsize;	/* includes sizeof section structs */
		char		segname[16];	/* segment name */
		uint32_t	vmaddr;		/* memory address of this segment */
		uint32_t	vmsize;		/* memory size of this segment */
		uint32_t	fileoff;	/* file offset of this segment */
		uint32_t	filesize;	/* amount to map from the file */
		vm_prot_t	maxprot;	/* maximum VM protection */
		vm_prot_t	initprot;	/* initial VM protection */
		uint32_t	nsects;		/* number of sections in segment */
		uint32_t	flags;		/* flags */
	};

`cmd` has to be `LC_SEGMENT`, and `cmdsize` has to be `sizeof(struct segment_command) => 0x38`.  
`segname` contents don't matter, and we'll use that later.

`vmaddr` has to be valid address (I'll use `0x1000`), `vmsize` has to be valid & multiple of `PAGE_SIZE`, `fileoff` has to be `0`, `filesize` has to be smaller than size of file, but larger than `mach_header` at least (`sizeof(header) + header.sizeofcmds` is what I've used).  

`maxprot` and `initprot` have to be `VM_PROT_READ | VM_PROT_EXECUTE`. `maxport` usually also has `VM_PROT_WRITE`.  
`nsects` are 0, since we don't really need any sections and they'll add up to size.
I've set `flags` to 0.

Now, we need to execute some code. There are two load commands for that: `entry_point_command` and `thread_command`.  
`entry_point_command` doesn't suit us: see `xnu-4570.1.46/bsd/kern/mach_loader.c`, around line 1977:

	1977  	/* kernel does *not* use entryoff from LC_MAIN.	 Dyld uses it. */
	1978  	result->needs_dynlinker = TRUE;
	1979  	result->using_lcmain = TRUE;

So, using it would require getting DYLD to work, and that means we'll need `__LINKEDIT`, empty `symtab_command` and `dysymtab_command`, `dylinker_command` and `dyld_info_command`. Overkill for "smallest" file.

So, we'll use `thread_command`, specifically `LC_UNIXTHREAD` since it also sets up stack which we'll need.  

	struct thread_command {
		uint32_t	cmd;		/* LC_THREAD or  LC_UNIXTHREAD */
		uint32_t	cmdsize;	/* total size of this command */
		/* uint32_t flavor		   flavor of thread state */
		/* uint32_t count		   count of uint32_t's in thread state */
		/* struct XXX_thread_state state   thread state for this flavor */
		/* ... */
	};

`cmd` is going to be `LC_UNIXTHREAD`, `cmdsize` would be `0x50` (see below).  
`flavour` is `x86_THREAD_STATE32`, and count is `x86_THREAD_STATE32_COUNT` (`0x10`).

Now the `thread_state`. We need `x86_thread_state32_t` aka `_STRUCT_X86_THREAD_STATE32`:

	#define	_STRUCT_X86_THREAD_STATE32	struct __darwin_i386_thread_state
	_STRUCT_X86_THREAD_STATE32
	{
	    unsigned int	__eax;
	    unsigned int	__ebx;
	    unsigned int	__ecx;
	    unsigned int	__edx;
	    unsigned int	__edi;
	    unsigned int	__esi;
	    unsigned int	__ebp;
	    unsigned int	__esp;
	    unsigned int	__ss;
	    unsigned int	__eflags;
	    unsigned int	__eip;
	    unsigned int	__cs;
	    unsigned int	__ds;
	    unsigned int	__es;
	    unsigned int	__fs;
	    unsigned int	__gs;
	};

So, it is indeed 16 `uint32_t`'s which would be loaded into corresponding registers before thread is started.

Adding header, segment command and thread command gives us `0xA4` bytes.

Now, time to craft the payload.  
Let's say we want it to print `Hi Frand` and `exit(0)`.  

Syscall convention for macOS x86_32: 

 - arguments passed on the stack, pushed right-to-left
 - stack 16-bytes aligned (note: 8-bytes aligned seems to be fine)
 - syscall number in the eax register
 - call by interrupt

See more about syscalls on macOS [here](https://filippo.io/making-system-calls-from-assembly-in-mac-os-x/).

So, knowing that, here's our payload in assembly:

    push   ebx          #; push chars 5-8
    push   eax          #; push chars 1-4
    xor    eax, eax     #; zero eax
    mov    edi, esp     #; preserve string address on stack
    push   0x8          #; 3rd param for write -- length
    push   edi          #; 2nd param for write -- address of bytes
    push   0x1          #; 1st param for write -- fd (stdout)
    push   eax          #; align stack
    mov    al, 0x4      #; write syscall number
    #; --- 14 bytes at this point ---
    int    0x80         #; syscall
    push   0x0          #; 1st param for exit -- exit code
    mov    al, 0x1      #; exit syscall number
    push   eax          #; align stack
    int    0x80         #; syscall

Notice the line before first `int 0x80`.  
`segname` can be anything, remember? So we can put our payload in it. However, it's only 16 bytes, and we need a bit more.  
So, at `14` bytes we'll place a `jmp`.

Another "free" space is thread state registers.  
We can set anything in most of them, and we'll put rest of our payload there.

Also, we place our string in `__eax` and `__ebx`, since it's shorter than mov'ing them.

So, we can use `__ecx`, `__edx`, `__edi` to fit the rest of our payload.
Looking at difference between address of `thread_cmd.state.__ecx` and end of `segment_cmd.segname` we calculate that we need to put `jmp 0x3a` (or `EB38`) in last two bytes of `segname`.

So, our payload assembled is `53 50 31C0 89E7 6A08 57 6A01 50 B004` for first part, `EB38` for jmp, and `CD80 6A00 B001 50 CD80` for second part.

And last step -- setting the `__eip`. Our file is loaded at `0x1000` (remember `vmaddr`), and payload starts at offset `0x24`.

Here's `xxd` of result file:

	00000000: cefa edfe 0700 0000 0300 0000 0200 0000  ................

Pad it with anything up to `0x1000` bytes, chmod +x and run :)
Or downloaded padded file [here](/assets/minmacho_x86_32).

P.S. About x86_64 -- 64bit binaries are required to have `__PAGEZERO` (any mapping with `VM_PROT_NONE` protection covering page at 0x0). IIRC they [Apple] didn't make it required on 32bit mode only because some legacy software didn't have it and they're afraid to break it.
