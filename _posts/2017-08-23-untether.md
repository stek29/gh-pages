title: Finding offsets for UntetherHomeDepot
---

### Before you start
Maybe your offsets are already in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/stek29/52b14b851089895fa66fde383d1bdbe5). You may want to check it.

### Prerequirements
I'm going to use macOS in this guide
Get [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), Xcode CLI tools (or full Xcode installation).
Then install openssl from homebrew:

```sh
brew install openssl
```

You'll also need [Hopper](https://www.hopperapp.com/), IDA or any other disassembler. I'll use Hopper in this guide.

### Getting kernelcache
If your device is already jailbroken, then grap `/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kernelcaches/kernelcache`
If it's not, [get ipsw](https://ipsw.me/) and unextract it (it's a ZIP archive afaik), and grab `kernelcache.release.j2a`.

### Getting IV and Key
Then check your build number (Settings => General => About => Version, like 13F69), and iDevice version (like `iPad3,3`, it is shown in HomeDepot and Cydia)

After that go to theiphonewiki and type version and iDevice into search bar, and get to page about that firmware.
[For `iPad3,3` on iOS 9.3.2 (13F69)](https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Frisco_13F69_(iPad3,3))

Scroll to Kernelcache and note IV and Key.

### Compiling xpwntool-lite
Open terminal. Get xpwntool-lite sources:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sektioneins/xpwntool-lite
cd xpwntool-lite
```

Apple ships it's own libcrypto and libssl, and because of that Homebrew doesn't link OpenSSL into `/usr/local` after installation. Instead you'd have to specify CFLAGS.

```sh
make CFLAGS="-L `brew --prefix openssl`/lib -I `brew --prefix openssl`/include"
```

After that you should have xpwntool-lite compiled. Try running `./xpwntool`, you should see it's usage.

### Decrypting and extracting kernelcache
Get the key, IV, kernelcache file and xpwntool together.
If kernelcache is in the same dir as xpwntool:

```sh
./xpwntool kernelcache kernelcache.dec -k KEY -iv IV
```

For iPad3,3 on iOS 9.3.2:

```sh
# Don't copy paste :)
./xpwntool kernelcache kernelcache.dec -k 24bbf75e6e4fe9a989e30649abbcab6dacb0b669f95574cd44d9ef0264d9d85d -iv f920a49fc62c38a8a373fce65f060170
```

After that decrypted kernelcache should be in `kernelcache.dec`:

```
$ file kernelcache.dec
kernelcache.dec: Mach-O executable arm_v7
```

### Getting the offsets
Now load the file into Hopper. Use default options, and let the processing begin. 

While Hopper is doing it's stuff, go to [wall.supplies](http://wall.supplies/offsets.html) and look up offsets for normal HomeDepot your device.
You'll need 5th offset, for iPad 3,3 on iOS 9.3.2 it's `0x403428`.

If offsets for your device are not there, use [Karen's page](https://angelxwind.net/?page/trident-address-tutorial) and ["Custom offsets format"](http://wall.supplies/offsets.html)

When you have 5th offset, press G, select "File Offset", enter that offset.
Then keep pressing D until it turns into `dd 0xXXXXXXXX`. Do same thing for next 5 lines.

Here's how it looks like for iPad3,3 on iOS 9.3.2:

```
80404428         dd         0x8001f145
8040442c         dd         0x00000000
80404430         dd         0x00000000
80404434         dd         0x8001f171
80404438         dd         0x8001f191
```

And those are the offsets.
Second and third should be null afaik, I lost the reference though. I think it was in lookout's pdf.

### Getting kernel version
Just do this in terminal:

```
strings kernelcache.dec|grep Darwin
```

You'll get two lines:
```
Darwin Kernel Version 15.5.0: Mon Apr 18 16:44:06 PDT 2016; root:xnu-3248.50.21~4/RELEASE_ARM_S5L8945X
Darwin
```

First one is Kernel Version you should put in `offsets.json`.

### Making an offsets.json file
Use offsets for homedepot from wall.supplies (or ones you found on your own), and ones you found with Hopper on clock_ops.
Then add your kernel version, and get something like this (iPad 3,3 on iOS 9.3.2 once again)

```json
{
  "Darwin Kernel Version 15.6.0: Mon Jun 20 20:10:21 PDT 2016; root:xnu-3248.60.9~1/RELEASE_ARM_S5L8940X":
   ["0x318388",
    "0x31ab90",
    "0x1e200",
    "0xd9838",
    "0x403428",
    "0xc76b4",
    "0xd983a",
    "0xc73e8",
    "0x455844",
    "0x3f6454",
    "0xc7440",
    "0x45717c",
    "0xa4",
    "0x8001f1d5",
    "0x0",
    "0x0",
    "0x8001f201",
    "0x8001f221"
  ]
}
```

Put that into `/untether/offsets.json` and reboot.

### Helping communtiy
If everything goes well, please, share your offsets. 
I'm currently maintaining [a gist](https://gist.github.com/stek29/52b14b851089895fa66fde383d1bdbe5), and I'd love to see your offsets there.
